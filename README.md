# Air_Quality_Index_Tableau_dashboard
Objective:
The objective of this Tableau project is to showcase data storytelling, visualization techniques, and dashboard creation using the India Air Quality dataset sourced from Kaggle. Through this visualization, I aim to demonstrate my Tableau skills and provide insights that could be beneficial to others interested in data visualization.

Dataset Overview:
The India Air Quality dataset comprises historical daily ambient air quality data collected across various states and cities in India. It is a consolidated and mostly clean version of data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).

Dataset Characteristics:
Stn_code: Station codes for states or cities.
Sampling_Date: Month and air quality report code.
State: Names of states.
Location: Names of cities.
Agency: Local authority name responsible for data collection.
So2: Levels of sulfur dioxide.
No2: Levels of nitrogen dioxide.
Rspm: Levels of respirable suspended particulate matter.
Spm: Levels of suspended particulate matter.
location_monitoring_station: Place where air quality is measured.
pm2_5: Levels of particulate matter between 2 and 5 micrometers.
Date: Monthly dates from 1987 to 2000.
Type: Zone in which air quality measurements were taken (e.g., industrial, residential).
Data Cleaning:
The dataset required minimal preprocessing before visualization. Basic cleaning tasks, such as renaming columns and correcting spelling errors in cities and states, were performed using Microsoft Excel. However, the dataset was largely ready for visualization without extensive preprocessing.

Air Quality Measurements:
SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide) and NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide): These are among the most dangerous outdoor air pollutants. NO2 exposure outdoors may increase the risk of respiratory tract infections. SO2 contributes to respiratory symptoms in both healthy individuals and those with underlying pulmonary diseases.
RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter): Produced from combustion processes, vehicles, and industrial sources, RSPM can have adverse effects on health.

Conclusion:
Through this Tableau project, I aim to provide a visually compelling representation of India's air quality data. The visualizations and dashboards created offer insights into air pollution levels across different regions and highlight the significance of monitoring and addressing air quality issues for public health and environmental well-being.
